## ‚úÖ Tour Storage - Persistent & Secure

### Tours ARE Stored Permanently

Tours are **permanently stored** in the Supabase database and will remain there indefinitely unless explicitly deleted. Here's how:

#### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.tours (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  warehouse_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.warehouses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  host_id UUID REFERENCES public.team_members(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  time TIME NOT NULL,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'scheduled',
  tour_numeric_id INTEGER UNIQUE,
  notes TEXT,
  selected_workflows JSONB,
  selected_skus TEXT[],
  workflow_config JSONB,
  order_summary JSONB,
  instruction_guide TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

### Tour Status Values

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `scheduled` | Tour is created but orders haven't been generated yet |
| `finalized` | Orders have been created in ShipHero |
| `cancelled` | Tour and/or orders have been cancelled (tour record remains) |

### When Tours Are Deleted

Tours are **ONLY** deleted when:

1. **Explicit Manual Deletion** via "Clear All Tours" button:
   - Requires **TWO confirmations**
   - Labeled as "FOR TESTING ONLY"
   - Found in: View Tours page

2. **Warehouse Deletion** (Cascade):
   ```sql
   warehouse_id REFERENCES warehouses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
   ```
   - If a warehouse is deleted, all its tours are deleted
   - This protects referential integrity

3. **Host Deletion** (Does NOT delete tour):
   ```sql
   host_id REFERENCES team_members(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
   ```
   - If a host is deleted, the `host_id` is set to NULL
   - The tour record remains intact

### What's Stored in Tours

Each tour stores:
- ‚úÖ **Basic info**: Date, time, warehouse, host, notes
- ‚úÖ **Participants**: All attendees with contact info
- ‚úÖ **Workflow configuration**: Which order types to create
- ‚úÖ **Selected SKUs**: Products for the tour
- ‚úÖ **Order summary**: Complete record of all created orders
  - Order numbers
  - ShipHero IDs
  - Recipient information
  - Success/failure status
- ‚úÖ **Creation timestamp**: When tour was scheduled

## ‚úÖ Tour Cancellation - Fully Functional

### What "Cancel Entire Tour" Does

The cancellation feature in the Tour Summary Dialog:

1. ‚úÖ **Cancels all orders in ShipHero** via API
2. ‚úÖ **Updates UI** to show canceled status
3. ‚úÖ **Keeps tour record** in database with order history
4. ‚úÖ **Tracks which orders were canceled** successfully

### Cancellation Process

#### Step 1: User Clicks "Cancel Entire Tour"
Location: `components/tour-summary-dialog.tsx:568`

```typescript
const cancelEntireTour = async () => {
  // 1. Get all sales and purchase orders
  const allSalesOrders = data.orders.sales_orders || []
  const allPurchaseOrders = data.orders.purchase_orders || []
  
  // 2. Cancel each order via ShipHero API
  // 3. Track success/failure
  // 4. Update UI state
}
```

#### Step 2: API Calls to ShipHero
Endpoint: `/api/shiphero/cancel-orders`

**For Sales Orders:**
```graphql
mutation {
  order_cancel(data: {
    order_id: "order-id"
    reason: "Tour canceled"
  }) {
    order {
      id
      order_number
      fulfillment_status
    }
  }
}
```

**For Purchase Orders:**
```graphql
mutation {
  purchase_order_set_fulfillment_status(data: {
    po_id: "po-id"
    status: "canceled"
  }) {
    purchase_order {
      id
      po_number
      fulfillment_status
    }
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Results Displayed
- ‚úÖ Success: "Entire Tour Canceled - Successfully canceled all X orders"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial: "Partial Tour Cancellation - Canceled X/Y orders"
- ‚ùå Failure: "Tour Cancellation Failed - Failed to cancel any orders"

### What Cancellation Does NOT Do

‚ùå Does NOT delete the tour from the database  
‚ùå Does NOT delete participants  
‚ùå Does NOT delete the order summary  
‚ùå Does NOT affect historical data  

### Why Keep Tours After Cancellation?

‚úÖ **Historical record** - Know what tours were scheduled  
‚úÖ **Audit trail** - Track all order activity  
‚úÖ **Analysis** - Understand cancellation patterns  
‚úÖ **Reference** - Can review why/when tours were canceled

## Data Retention & Compliance

### What's Stored Long-Term

‚úÖ **Tour records**: Permanent (unless explicitly deleted)  
‚úÖ **Participant information**: Permanent (linked to tours)  
‚úÖ **Order summaries**: Permanent (JSON in tour record)  
‚úÖ **Timestamps**: Creation dates for all records  

### What's NOT Stored

‚ùå **Credit card info**: Never stored (not used)  
‚ùå **Passwords**: Not applicable (no user accounts per tenant)  
‚ùå **ShipHero tokens**: Stored encrypted, not in tour records  

### Data Export

To export tour data:
```sql
-- All tours
SELECT * FROM tours;

-- Tours with details
SELECT 
  t.*,
  w.name as warehouse_name,
  h.first_name || ' ' || h.last_name as host_name,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tour_participants WHERE tour_id = t.id) as participant_count
FROM tours t
LEFT JOIN warehouses w ON t.warehouse_id = w.id
LEFT JOIN team_members h ON t.host_id = h.id
ORDER BY t.created_at DESC;
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Going Live

1. ‚úÖ Create test tour
2. ‚úÖ Add test participants
3. ‚úÖ Finalize tour (creates orders)
4. ‚úÖ View tour summary
5. ‚úÖ Test order cancellation
6. ‚úÖ Verify orders canceled in ShipHero
7. ‚úÖ Verify tour remains in database
8. ‚úÖ Use "Clear All Tours" to clean up

### Production Best Practices

1. **Regular backups**: Supabase provides automatic backups
2. **Monitor tour status**: Check for failed orders
3. **Review cancellations**: Understand why tours are canceled
4. **Archive old tours**: Optional - export and delete very old tours

- Check database directly

### Cancellation Fails

**Issue:** "Cancel Entire Tour" fails  
**Solution:**
- Verify ShipHero access token is valid
- Check order IDs are correct
- Look at browser console for error details
- Try canceling individual workflows first

### Orders Not Created

**Solution:**
- Check ShipHero API credentials
- Verify warehouse IDs are correct
- Check SKUs exist in ShipHero
- Review tour order_summary for error messages
