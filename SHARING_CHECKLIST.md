# Sharing & Security Checklist

## ✅ Safe to Share

This app is **100% safe to share with clients**. Here's why:

### No Hardcoded Secrets in Logic

**What's NOT hardcoded:**
- ✅ ShipHero tokens - Always uses what user enters
- ✅ Supabase credentials - Set per deployment via environment variables
- ✅ Database access - Each client gets their own isolated database
- ✅ API keys - Configured per deployment

### What IS in the Code (But Safe)

**DEV ONLY Token Display:**
- **Location:** Settings → ShipHero tab (amber box)
- **Purpose:** Development convenience - quick copy for testing
- **Impact:** Zero - just pre-fills the input field
- **Client Impact:** They simply ignore it and enter their own token

**How It Works:**
1. Box shows a sample token
2. User can click to copy it (optional)
3. OR user can type/paste their own token
4. User clicks "Save Token"
5. **App uses whatever token was saved** - not the dev sample

## 🔐 Security Features

### Per-Client Isolation

Each client deployment has:
- ✅ **Separate Supabase database** - No shared data
- ✅ **Separate Vercel project** - Isolated environment  
- ✅ **Own environment variables** - No credential sharing
- ✅ **Own ShipHero tokens** - They use their account
- ✅ **Own domain** (optional) - Custom branding

### No Cross-Client Risk

**Impossible scenarios:**
- ❌ Client A cannot see Client B's data
- ❌ Client A cannot use Client B's ShipHero account
- ❌ Client A cannot access Client B's database
- ❌ Tokens stored locally in browser (not shared between users)

## 📋 Before Sharing with New Client

### Option 1: Share As-Is (Recommended)
**Just share the app!** They'll:
1. Open the app
2. See Settings → ShipHero tab
3. Enter their own refresh token
4. Start using the app

**The DEV ONLY box doesn't hurt anything** - it's clearly labeled as dev-only.

### Option 2: Remove DEV ONLY Box (Optional)

If you want a cleaner look for production clients:

1. **Edit:** `components/settings/shiphero-tab.tsx`
2. **Remove lines 1043-1069** (the amber DEV ONLY box)
3. **Commit and deploy**

**Or create a production branch:**
```bash
git checkout -b production
# Remove DEV ONLY section
git commit -m "Remove dev helpers for production"
git push origin production
# Deploy production branch to client's Vercel
```

## 🚀 Deployment Options for Clients

### Method 1: Fresh Clone (Cleanest)
```bash
./setup-new-client.sh acme-corp
# Gets fresh copy, no dev token visible
```

### Method 2: Production Branch
```bash
git clone -b production https://github.com/mostafa-azimi/ship_demo.git
# Uses production branch without dev helpers
```

### Method 3: As-Is
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mostafa-azimi/ship_demo.git
# Includes dev helper (clearly labeled, no security risk)
```

## ✅ What Clients Need

Each new client needs:

1. **ShipHero Refresh Token**
   - They get this from their ShipHero account
   - Settings → Developer → API Access
   - Completely separate from your token

2. **Supabase Project**
   - New project for them
   - Fresh database
   - Their own credentials

3. **Vercel Deployment**
   - New project for them
   - Their own URL
   - Separate from yours

---

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**The app is 100% ready to share!**

- ✅ No hardcoded secrets in the logic
- ✅ Each client uses their own tokens
- ✅ Complete isolation between clients
- ✅ DEV ONLY box is just a UI helper (optional to remove)
- ✅ All client data stays in their own database

**You can confidently share this with clients right now!** 🎉

## 📞 When Onboarding a Client

**Tell them:**
1. "Go to Settings → ShipHero tab"
2. "Enter your ShipHero refresh token"
3. "Click 'Generate New Access Token'"
4. "You're all set!"

*Optional: "Ignore the 'DEV ONLY' box - that's just for development testing"*
